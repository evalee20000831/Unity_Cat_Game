# Unity_Game
This repository has 2 projects both of which are not fully completed. I did this project back in 2020 for fun without any experience of programming games. 

## Cat Game
I made a background for this cat game but no object to play the game yet.

## Moving Object Game
I made an oval object that can jump once and two consecutive times, following the physics when it touches the ground blocks or obstacles.
